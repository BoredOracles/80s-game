Enemy Generation Algorithm:

Sword = 5
Car = 7
Lazer = 10

enemies = []
total = 0
while total < score {
	enemy = new random enemy
	enemies.append( enemy )
	total += enemy.value
	total *= length(enemies)
}

for enemy : enemies
	assign random time from 0 to 5 seconds - wait that long before spawning
	if car: assign random x from 0-4
		multiply by like 48 or something
	else:
		assign random x from 0 to (screenwidth - enemywidth)

listen for when that time has elapsed
